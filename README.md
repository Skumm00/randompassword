How to Use: Just run the program and then you can create, edit, and view your account and other features all on the command line, and without any UI as I belive it removes the joy and feel of coding. 

How to Open: Download or open the repo on your proferred text -editor (I reccemond VS code) and then run the program to execute the code. It also has user responsiveness so the user can create accounts and view info and whatnot.
